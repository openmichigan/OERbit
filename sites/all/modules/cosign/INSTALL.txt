Installation instructions
---------------------------
* you must be running your server within a cosign infrastructure.
	More info at: http://www.weblogin.org/
* download the cosign module
* download the webserver_auth module, upon which cosign depends
* copy the modules into your drupal modules directory
* enable the modules through the ?q=admin/build/modules page
* add the logout block to your page with the ?q=admin/build/block page

Warning 
--------
When enabling cosign, all users mentioned in the user table will be
copied into the authmap table. This means that any pre-existing local
users will be converted over to user@$_SERVER[REMOTE_REALM].  This may
cause a mis-identification, and potential security issue if you had
a user registered locally, and that name is mapped to someone else
when using cosign.

For example, I may have chosen the username 'willie' for my local
drupal user. Although when using cosign, my username is 'willn'. In
this case, by turning on cosign I've lost access to my former username,
and another user would have access to all of my previous documents,
comments, preferences, etc.  A more serious situation would be if your
admin user doesn't share your username.  If you turn on cosign without
changing your admin username, then you suddenly lose your
administration account.

Be sure to vet your authmap list before "opening the doors" to
your userbase. It may be wise to only enable cosign authentication
on a brand new drupal installation.

You will become the admin user:
---------------------------------
When you turn on the cosign module, if your local drupal
username is not the same as your cosign username (taken from
$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']), then a destructive change will happen,
and your cosign user will become the new admin, and assume ownership
of the previous admin's postings, etc. This is to prevent someone
else from administering your drupal instance. Since you have the
permission to enable this module, then you must be authorized to be
the administrator.

Turning off the cosign module does not revert the admin user back to
using a local drupal account.
