  when editing the meta tags of a given object, instead they are only output
  during page generation. Also, most form elements will now show what the
  default value is on the edit form, so there is something to go from.
#1587758 by DamienMcKenna: Added the Logo meta tag.
#1412970 by DamienMcKenna: Follow-up patch for copy/paste mistake.

  for continuing the branch.
