Link Checker
------------

Installation:

1. Place the entire linkchecker folder into your modules directory.
2. Go to Administer -> Site building -> Modules and enable the Link checker module.
3. Go to Administer -> Site configuration -> Link checker and enable the node types to scan.
4. Check all HTML tags that should be scanned.
5. Adjust the other parameters if the defaults don't suit your needs.
6. Save configuration
7. Wait for cron to check all your links... this may take some time! :-)

If links are broken they appear under Administer -> Reports -> Broken links.

If not, make sure the cron is configured and running properly on your Drupal
installation. The Link checker module also logs somewhat useful info about it's
activity under Administer -> Reports -> Recent log entries.


Required:

1. For internal URL extraction you need to make sure that Cron always get called
   with your real public site URL (for e.g. http://example.com/cron.php). Make
   sure it's never executed with http://localhost/cron.php or any other
   hostnames or ports, not available from public. Otherwise all links may be
   reported as broken and cannot verified as they should be.

   To make sure it always works - it's required to configure the $base_url in
   the sites settings.php with your public sites URL. Better save than sorry!


Known issues:

1. drupal_http_request() does handle (invalid) non-absolute redirects. The
   main issue is a broken webserver configuration and you can try to notify
   the site owner about doing non-rfc compliant redirections.
   This is a very common administration fault from past days and core should
   implement a workaround. See http://drupal.org/node/164365 for more details.
   
   Until this issue is fixed in core the permanently moved links are not
   automatically fixed/updated by the "Update permanently moved links" feature
   to the newly provided URL.
   
   -> Workaround: Manually fix these links or try the patch.
